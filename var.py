"edain":
"One of Necro's favorite, allows him to search his favorite wiki.",

"lotr":
"Good for LOTR fact-checking. Although some would say it's better to use Tolkien Gateway",

"If you really think about it, it's kinda like ghosts talking to them.",

"pm":
"And now the ghosts are invading their PMs.",

"Auto-Moderation is like most of Necro's stuff. Looks nice on the frontend but the backend is a nightmare.",

"You should see the length of the `if` statement required to make that one work... *deep sigh*",

"kill":
"I don't wanna talk about that one. It makes me uncomfortable.",

"moddb":
"A beautiful command, the first in the long line of modding commands that will allow users to showcase their work.",

"setall":
"It's sort of automated but still a pain"
