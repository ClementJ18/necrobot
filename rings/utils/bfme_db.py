        "Destroying a settlement will return resource proportional to the amount of health left the building has. `Resources = (Building Cost / 2) * % of Health Left`",
        "Additional power points are gained depending on how many you currently have, the more power points the slower you gain them.",
        "Troll creeps will always hunt the closest nearby hero, with some micro you can easily drag him through some units to deal trample revenge damage.",

        "Mass slayers excel at slaying massive amounts of weak enemies and usually are equipped with AoE attacks and/or abilities. They don't always deal a lot of damage but often deal it in an area.",
        "Some Mass Slayer abilities can also be used to output an extremely high amount of damage if the target is isolated, such as Legolas' Arrow Wind or Gandalf's Lightining Sword.",
        "Hero Killers excel at outputting high amounts of damage to single targets, the base is damage is often higher than average and their abilities help them stay close to the enemy.",
        "Units and Hero Interfers are all about disrupting the enemy's strategy and timing. They are equipped with abilities that do not inflict significant direct damage but rather inflict debuffs and statuses on the enemy.",
        "Timing is very important in Edain, prematurely using all your hero abilities and spellbook powers means the opponent can pull back and wait for the effects to fade, on the other hand, using them too late gives your opponent time to dish out damage meaning your powers might be less effective or you might miss on certain hero abilities",
        "Units and Hero Supporters focus on aiding your troops in battle and are equipped with a wide range of temporary and permanent buffs."
